## Hi :wave:, I'm Mason!

I graduated in May 2020 from the [University of Oklahoma](https://www.ou.edu/) with a Bachelor's degree in Economics and International Studies, and I am now pursuing a Master's in Economics at the [Toulouse School of Economics](https://tse-fr.eu/) (TSE), where I focus on the [Economics of Markets and Organizations](https://www.tse-fr.eu/master-emo-international-track).

Some of my former university projects include [capital concentration in Argentina](https://masonrhayes.com/publication/radical-party/) at the beginning of the 20th century, [populism and economic inequality in Turkey](https://masonrhayes.com/publication/populism-and-inequality-in-turkey/), the optimization of [pay-what-you-want pricing models](https://masonrhayes.com/publication/pwyw/pwyw.pdf), and the relationship between increasing [industrial concentration and inequality in the United States](https://masonrhayes.com/publication/the-inegalitarian-spiral/). At TSE, my projects include examining the health and welfare effects of a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages, as well as using a quasi-experimental differences-in-differences approach to estimate the effects of an earthquake on the level of informal competition in Chile.

For my personal projects, I have created an R package, [`sciteR`](https://github.com/masonrhayes/sciteR), to gather journal-level citation data from [scite](https://scite.ai), a [Shiny web app](https://masonrhayes.shinyapps.io/coronavirus_app/) to track the spread of COVID-19, and a [simple R script](https://github.com/masonrhayes/cryptocurrency_analysis) to quickly visualize cryptocurrency price trends.
